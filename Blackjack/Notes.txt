Enums:
    Card face:
         Value in () 
    Suit enum:
        Can use the unicodes
    Might need to use nested for in the deck class and its just passed in the constructor of card which then sets the suit and face and value
Classes:
    Card:
        Variables:
            char suit
            int value
            char face
        Method:
            display() - this isnt even going to work because cards need to be in a row
    Deck:
        cards 
    Game:
        Deck
        takes variable number of decks
        Has to do with players balance, do I need a player class or just controlled by the game, maybe game
